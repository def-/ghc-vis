This document explains how to install ghc-vis on a fresh installation of Mac
OS X 10.8 on an x86_64 system.

== Install XQuartz

Visit http://xquartz.macosforge.org and install XQuartz. Reboot your system to
apply the changes.

== Install HomeBrew

Install the _Command Line Tools for Xcode_ from
https://developer.apple.com/downloads
.

Install HomeBrew as described on
http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/
:

----
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"
----

== Install GTK and GraphViz

----
brew install gtk graphviz
gtk-demo
----

If you're running a Hackintosh with an older CPU you have to set LLVM to
compile for your CPU instead of the one advertised by your virtual machine
(LLVM wrongly uses the CPU ID instead of its cap flags to determine which
instructions it supports). To do this open +/usr/local/Library/ENV/4.3/cc+ in
a text editor and replace +-march=native+ with +-march=core2+. See
https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues/19567#issuecomment-18888359
for more details.

== Install the Haskell Platform

Visit
http://www.haskell.org/platform/mac.html
and install the Haskell Platform.

== Set Correct Paths

Set up the correct executable and library paths by adding them to your
+.profile+:

----
cat <<EOT >> ~/.profile
export PATH=\$HOME/Library/Haskell/bin:/usr/local/bin:\$PATH
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig
export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib
export CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include
export LIBS=-L/usr/local/lib
EOT
source .profile
----

This is important as otherwise the linker will use the system's cairo version
instead of the one we just installed, leading to a segmentation fault. See
https://github.com/vslavik/diff-pdf/issues/13#issuecomment-18222977
for more details.

== Install ghc-vis

----
cabal update
cabal install gtk2hs-buildtools
cabal install ghc-vis --disable-library-profiling
----

Follow the instructions in the output of +cabal install ghc-vis+ to setup the
ghci script.
