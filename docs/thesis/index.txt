== Abstract

This thesis details the motivation, implementation and evaluation of ghc-vis,
a tool for visualizing Haskell data structures inside of GHCi and GHC compiled
programs at runtime. The layout of objects on the GHC heap is used as the
basis for two types of visualizations, which respectively aim to functionally
be supersets of GHCi's :print and vacuum-cairo. Examples for using ghc-vis to
further the understanding of lazy evaluation and sharing in Haskell are given.

The visualization of sharing and lazy evaluation in Haskell data structures
can be useful to enhance the comprehension of functional data structures and
algorithms and their perfomance in the environment of education, development
and debugging.

A new library for parsing and viewing graphs in Haskell, called xdot, was
created in order to interactively view graphs created by Graphviz.
